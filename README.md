## Molecular dynamics simulations reveal regions of instability on BG505 SOSIP HIV Envelope glycoprotein

HIV envelope (Env) is the sole target of neutralizing antibodies. Soluble and well-ordered Env mimetics are attractive vaccine candidates. Here we use molecular dynamics and ilmm to determine unstable regions of BG505 SOSIP trimer. BG505 SOSIP is a trimer of monomers of gp120 and truncated gp41 chains linked together by disulphides. MD and RosettaDesign simulations suggest stabilizing the helical HR2 domain of gp41 which interacts with unstable helix on the adjacent gp41 subunit. The stabilization of intersubunit interactions will generate novel homogenous and stable trimers.

Inspired by the Computational Protein Design BIOEN588 course at the University of Washington that I took in Winter 2016 with Valerie Daggett, and work in the Viral Biophysics lab with Kelly K Lee.
